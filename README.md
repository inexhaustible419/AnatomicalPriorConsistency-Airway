The 3D Pulmonary Airway Segmentation Framework is composed of two main components: the class-balanced CT density distribution reconstruction (DDR-CB) at the input stage and the Anatomical Prior-Based Multi-Task Learning
(AP-MTL) at the training stage.


Overview of Anatomical Prior-Based Multi-Task Learning. Follow the arrow to understand the entire process steps and the characteristics of the method.
